# CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION  

## Project Description

In this project, I aim to build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. I will use a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains information such as age, job, marital status, education, balance, and various other features about the customers. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can assist marketing efforts by identifying potential customers who are more likely to make a purchase  

## Business Understanding  

The project is important for businesses, especially in the marketing and sales domain, as it can help in targeting potential customers more effectively. By identifying customers who are likely to make a purchase, businesses can optimize their marketing strategies, allocate resources efficiently, and ultimately increase their conversion rates and revenue.
